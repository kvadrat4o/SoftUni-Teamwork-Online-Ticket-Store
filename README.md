  - Categorized catalog of venues with ability to view detailed information and purchase tickets (FE)
  - Administration interface for addition, editing and deletion of events (Admin panel)
4. Main functionalities required for all users: 
  -	View upcoming events
  - Browse categories of events
  - Advanced search (by category, date, price, location, etc.)
  - View details about an event (information, location, date, price and availability of tickets)
5. Additional functionalities
  5.1 For registerred users:
    •	Purchase tickets
    •	Manage their profile
  5.2 For authenticated administrators:
    •	Create / edit / delete events
    •	Manage available tickets
6. Notes
  6.1 Ticket count is updated live, to avoid conflicts. When purchasing a ticket, a user registration is required, but product basket is preserved.
  6.2 If you used a prototyping tool that works online, submit a link to your project page instead, and make sure it’s publicly accessible. Every team member submits the same link!
